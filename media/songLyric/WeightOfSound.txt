Weight of Sound (feat. TJ O'Neill) - Stick Figure
Composed by：Stick Figure
This one goes out to my girl tonight tonight tonight
I'll sing a song for you 'cause
The mood is right right right
It's ２１６ on a Saturday night night night
My girl she is passed out she's not
Feeling alright right right
Twenty four hours can be a long time
To be lying in bed from the previous night night
I'll sit here here and drink myself a beer beer
All night long I'll sing this
Song till you call on me yeah
Tomorrow will come and the sun will shine
Shine shine
Well I'll be sitting here right
By your side side side
So let the music soothe your soul soul
Let the music take control control
Everything you do or say comes back to you
When things don't work out
Right you got to push on through through through
So keep on running running running keep on moving moving moving
Everything is gonna be alright right right right
So keep on smiling smiling
Keep on laughing laughing
Every little thing is gonna be alright right right right
If you left this choice up to me me me
Don't tell me what you got girl
Baby please tell me what you need need need
Let must confess I've been blessed but
I'll never say never never never never
'Cause I could die today but this
Music lives forever ever ever ever
And nothing is impossible nothing
Is out of your reach reach reach
It's just another love song just another melody
Dy dy
So keep believing in your dreams life's
Not what it seems sometimes sometimes sometimes
And love the air you breathe
Yeah everything you need for tonight tonight tonight
Running away running away
So far from this place place running away
So keep on running no keep on moving yeah
Everything is gonna be alright right right right
So keep on smiling no keep on laughing yeah
Every little thing gonna be alright right right right
Playing on your radio coming through your stereo
And everybody's getting down
You can't seem to let it go running like a video
Your haunted by the weight of sound
In your eyes eyes you focus on the light light
And for tonight night just relax
And let's get high high
The sun it is a sinking low
I'm thinking that it' time to go
And everybody's headed home
Watch them as they come and go
Listen to your soul it knows
Can you feel the weight of sound
It's just love love there's nothing that's more real real
This love love and they way it makes you feel feel
